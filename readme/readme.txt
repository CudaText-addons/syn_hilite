Plugin for SynWrite.
It highlights current word or selected text, all occurences in file.
Hilites with "search marks" (default color is green-backgnd).
Plugin gives one command Config, to edit ini-config (restart SW after).

Multi-line sel not allowed.
Multi-carets not allowed.
Based on myCrack's plugin for CudaText.
And Alexey's work on that plugin.
